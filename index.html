            <p>It is a new national spelling competition to be held annually and open to 10 - 14 year old students in all senior primary and junior high schools. That's more than 9500 schools! Over 1,080,000 Australian students are currently eligible to have a go. Awesome!</p>

                3)  National Grand Final
            </p>
            <p>The winner of each District Final in every state and territory of Australia will travel to the National Grand Final to be held at the Seymour Centre, the University of Sydney, in August 2012, where a national champion will be determined.
